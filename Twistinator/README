This is the readme for Twistinator.

Twistinator is a tool to search for triples and words in an index.

Installation:
   In the future we will build a self-containing jar, but for now, you must
   compile the source yourself. All the necessary libraries are included.
   
Usage:
   Example scenario
      - First create an index:
         Application -c /tmp/twistinator -f doc/example.collection   \
            -reader AsynchronousCollectionReader
            
      - Then start the server:
         nl.naiaden.twistinator.server.TwistServer
         
      - Start the client:
         nl.naiaden.twistinator.client.TwistClient
         
      Now you will see that there are two results: sentences m1 and p2
